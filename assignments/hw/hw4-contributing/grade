60 / 100

The videos didn't have the educational content I was looking for.
When I received your rough draft for the music video, I commented that I thought you were going in the wrong direction, but you disregarded my advice and continued to make the music video anyways.
The other videos were not finished in time for me to give detailed feedback, and I never received a rough draft.
In the future, try to get the instructor's feedback sooner and more carefully follow their advice.
